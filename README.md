## Hi I'm curlpipe!

What I've built:

 - `SAHL` a language that transpiles to HTML and abstracts a lot of syntax, removing hurdles for writing markup. Written in Ruby.
 - `GWS` A weather display for showing forecasts for people in remote regions of the UK. Written in Python.
 - `Peacock` Helped contribute to a privacy-first browser written in ElectronJS.
 - (In progress, expected completion by 2021) `Ox`, a simple text editor with IDE like features built in. Written in Rust.
 - (In progress, expected completion by 2021) `Gaiko`, a social media application built to help me learn the MERN stack. Written in JS.
 - (Concept, expected to commence in 2021) `Telekon`, a privacy-respecting online music player for all platforms. Written in JS on desktop and web and dart for mobile devices.

My favourite languages:

 - Rust because its fast and safe and the compiler is a great teacher
 - Ruby because the syntax is the best amongst high level languages
 - Javascript because it is quite powerful and has a ton of libraries

Technologies I am familiar with:

 - Rust
 - Ruby
 - HTML + CSS + Javascript
 - Crystal
 - Nim
 - Python
 - Vim Script
 - C

Technologies I plan to learn in the future:

 - Dart mainly because of flutter
 - Haskell because why not ;)
 - GraphQL because it seems to be quite popular
 - Docker because it is widely used
 - AWS because it is also widely used
 - JavaScript
    - React.JS
        - Styled Components
        - Next.JS
    - Svelte
    - Typescript because I like statically typed languages

Languages I do not like so much:

 - Python because of its pathetic speeds
 - Java because of its forced OOP
 - C++ because of its evil syntax
